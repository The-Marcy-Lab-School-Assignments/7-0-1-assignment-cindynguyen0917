# Question

Consider the React component below. Explain the three ways that we can provide a dependency array to trigger the `useEffect` callback to run. For each, provide an example of the dependency array to help explain your answer.

```js
const MyComponent = ({ someProp }) => {
  const [someState, setSomeState] = useState('');

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('hello world');
  }, '???');

  return (
    <div>
      <!-- Some More JSX -->
    </div>
  );
}
```

# Answer

We can pass 3 different arguments for a dependecy array that will change when the `useEffect` is triggered.
Firstly, we can pass in an empty array which will only trigger the `useEffect` callback during the initial render of the component. This happens because the array is suppose to contain a dependency that the hook will look out for in case of changes, but since the array is empty, no changes will be caught by the hook.
Secondly, we can pass in `[someState]` as a dependency array which will trigger `useEffect` everytime the `someState` value is updated or changed.
Lastly, we can also not provide a dependency array because it is optional. By not providing an argument, the `useEffect` will run every time the component is rendered.

# Teacher Feedback
Yes! These are the three ways that we can provide a dependency array.
