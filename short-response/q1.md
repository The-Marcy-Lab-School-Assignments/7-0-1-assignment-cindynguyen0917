# Question

What are the two arguments that `useEffect` accepts? 

# Answer
`useEffect` accepts two arguments were are a function and an array of dependencies. The function is required (considered the effect) and will be called whenever the component is re-rendered and if the dependencies have changed (the second argument). However, the array of dependencies is optional for the `useEffect` hook. If you choose to omit this array, the effect will run everytime the component is rendered.
